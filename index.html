        <h2><b>PROBLEM STATEMENT</b></h2>
        <p>Despite global economic progress, inequalities persist within and among countries, disproportionately affecting marginalized and vulnerable communities. Economic disparities, social exclusion, and discriminatory policies limit access to education, healthcare, and employment opportunities. Unequal wealth distribution, barriers to financial services, and restrictive migration policies further widen the gap between different social and economic groups.

            To achieve SDG 10, it is crucial to eliminate discrimination, promote inclusive policies, and ensure equal opportunities for all, regardless of age, gender, ethnicity, disability, or economic status. Addressing these challenges requires global cooperation, progressive policies, and sustained efforts to create a fair and just society.</p>
